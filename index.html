    <header><h2>Introduction</h2></header>
    <p>JavaScript is a cross-platform, object-oriented scripting language. It is a small and lightweight language.
      Inside a host environment (for example, a web browser), JavaScript can be connected to the objects of its
      environment to provide programmatic control over them.</p>
    <p>JavaScript contains a standard library of objects, such as Array, Date, and Math, and a core set of language
      elements such as operators, control structures, and statements. Core JavaScript can be extended for a variety of
      purposes by supplementing it with additional objects; for example:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Client-side JavaScript extends the core language by supplying objects to control a browser and its Document
        Object Model (DOM). For example, client-side extensions allow an application to place elements on an HTML form
        and respond to user events such as mouse clicks, form input, and page navigation.
      </li>
      <li>
        Server-side JavaScript extends the core language by supplying objects relevant to running JavaScript on a
        server. For example, server-side extensions allow an application to communicate with a database, provide
        continuity of information from one invocation to another of the application, or perform file manipulations on a
        server.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <header><h2>What you should already know</h2></header>
    <p>This guide assumes you have the following basic background:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>A general understanding of the Internet and the World Wide Web (WWW).</li>
      <li>Good working knowledge of HyperText Markup Language (HTML).</li>
      <li>
        Some programming experience. If you are new to programming, try one of the tutorials linked on the main page
        about JavaScript.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </section>
  <section class="main-section" id="Hello_world">
    <header><h2>Hello world</h2></header>
    <p>To get started with writing JavaScript, open the Scratchpad and write your first "Hello world" JavaScript
      code:</p>
    <pre><code>function greetMe(yourName) {
  alert("Hello " + yourName);
}
greetMe("World");</code></pre>
    <p>Select the code in the pad and hit Ctrl+R to watch it unfold in your browser!</p>
  </section>
  <section class="main-section" id="Variables">
    <header><h2>Variables</h2></header>
    <p>You use variables as symbolic names for values in your application. The names of variables, called identifiers,
      conform to certain rules.</p>
    <p>A JavaScript identifier must start with a letter, underscore (_), or dollar sign ($); subsequent characters can
      also be digits (0-9). Because JavaScript is case sensitive, letters include the characters "A" through "Z"
      (uppercase) and the characters "a" through "z" (lowercase).</p>
    <p>You can use ISO 8859-1 or Unicode letters such as å and ü in identifiers. You can also use the Unicode escape
      sequences as characters in identifiers. Some examples of legal names are Number_hits, temp99, and _name.</p>
  </section>
  <section class="main-section" id="Declaring_variables">
    <header><h2>Declaring variables</h2></header>
    <p>You can declare a variable in three ways:</p>
    <p>With the keyword var. For example,</p>
    <pre><code>var x = 42.</code></pre>
    <p>This syntax can be used to declare both local and global variables.</p>
    <p>By simply assigning it a value. For example,</p>
    <pre><code>x = 42.</code></pre>
    <p>This always declares a global variable. It generates a strict JavaScript warning. You shouldn't use this
      variant.</p>
    <p>With the keyword let. For example,</p>
    <pre><code>let y = 13.</code></pre>
    <p>This syntax can be used to declare a block scope local variable. See Variable scope below.</p>
  </section>
  <section class="main-section" id="Constants">
    <header><h2>Constants</h2></header>
    <p>You can create a read-only, named constant with the const keyword. The syntax of a constant identifier is the
      same as for a variable identifier: it must start with a letter, underscore or dollar sign and can contain
      alphabetic, numeric, or underscore characters.</p>
    <pre><code>const PI = 3.14;    </code></pre>
    <p>A constant cannot change value through assignment or be re-declared while the script is running. It has to be
      initialized to a value.</p>
    <p>The scope rules for constants are the same as those for let block scope variables. If the const keyword is
      omitted, the identifier is assumed to represent a variable.</p>
    <p>You cannot declare a constant with the same name as a function or variable in the same scope. For example:</p>
    <pre><code>// THIS WILL CAUSE AN ERROR
function f() {};
const f = 5;
// THIS WILL CAUSE AN ERROR ALSO
function f() {
  const g = 5;
  var g;
  //statements
}</code></pre>
    <p>However, object attributes are not protected, so the following statement is executed without problems.</p>
    <pre><code>const MY_OBJECT = {"key": "value"};
MY_OBJECT.key = "otherValue";</code></pre>
